# OGAS
Online Genetic Algorithm for Screenings (OGAS)
The OGAS tool project aims to generate the conditions necessary for successful crystal growth. OGAS uses a variation of the genetic algorithm that explores unexplored territories of the chemical search space, thereby increasing the probability of finding a new crystalline condition.
